The Smart Restaurant System lets customers scan a QR code to view the menu, order, and pay from their table. Orders go directly to the kitchen, where Arduino-powered alerts notify staff in real time. A backend dashboard allows efficient order tracking. This system enhances customer experience, reduces wait times, and improves order accuracy.
